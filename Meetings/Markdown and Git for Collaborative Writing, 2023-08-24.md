- Tech-savvy but not a coder, may need Git+Markdown for projects
- cowriting — can this be better than Google Docs?
- "Getting The Prices Right" — curated, ~15-essay book, multi-author anthology, with cross comments
- "Structural Defects of Capital-ism" — "book" I'm writing…and wonder about doing it "in the open" with a small or large group of collaborators
- I'm already a software dev, but I'm getting into technical writing, and want to do it multi-player
