## Topics

Main goals for this meeting and maybe 1 or 2 more meetings:

- [ ] Getting everyone to have accounts on GitHub
- [ ] Getting everyone to start using the command line on their computer
- [ ] Getting everyone to have Git and GitHub CLI installed
- [ ] Getting everyone to clone (sync) a public repository onto their machine
- [ ] Committing to working on some specific shared writing for a while

Stretch goals:

- create repo(s) and use it/them
- change repo settings
- connect a repo to Massive Wiki Publisher

## Creating a new repo

- if you want Massive Wiki Publisher, start at <https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massive-wiki-publishing-kit>
- end result: <https://basic-democracy.prosefusion.cloud/>



## Q & A

Q: Are we using the command line in the hope of enabling more technical knowledge and richer collaboration via Git?

Q: working in public; accepting changes

PK: current learning is typically by apprenticeship (Git and GitHub)

## Things We Might Work On

Scenarios for an optimistic 10-year future

## Instructions for Installing Git and GitHub CLI

Pete is working on written instructions for installing Git and GitHub CLI on your computer. He will also create a screencast demo, which will be distributed as an on-demand video lesson through the Path Shift People website. On the PSP site, it will be offered as a paid course (perhaps US$7.95), but Prose Fusion members will be able to get it at no charge.

### Windows

We have [older instructions](https://prosefusion.cloud/git_and_github_notes/windows_new_user_git_and_github_-_obsidian_setup,_2021-06-20), but we may want to try something newer.

Right now, I (Pete) am thinking:

- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) (Microsoft Store) or <https://github.com/microsoft/terminal>
- GitHub CLI - <https://github.com/cli/cli#windows>
    - probably using WinGet
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Mac

Text of the first lesson is available on the Prose Fusion site:

- [Installing Git and GitHub CLI on Mac](https://prosefusion.cloud/how-tos/installing_git_and_github_cli_on_mac)

I (Pete) have tested it a number of times on new Mac virtual machines, but it hasn't been tried on anybody else's Mac. Use a little caution.
