Let's try Mondays. I'm going to do two meetings to start, to cover more timezones. Meetings will generally repeat each Monday at the same times (modulo the upcoming seasonal time change).  

Don't feel like you have to attend both, just pick the best time for you.  

It's also okay to join whenever during the meeting, don't worry if you can't be there when the meeting starts.  

Note: The seasonal time change is coming up in a few weeks, and will cause schedule changes depending on your country and timezone. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience!
