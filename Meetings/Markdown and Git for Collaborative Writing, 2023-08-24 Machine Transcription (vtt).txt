00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.160
Howdy, this is Markdown plus Git for collaborative writing on August 24th, 2023.


00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.040
There's a HackMD, I think maybe you can see the HackMD link in the chat.


00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.160
You've probably also got it in email.


00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.920
The YouTube link in chat is to the last session.


00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.280
And we're kind of scheduled for an hour today to the top of the hour.


00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.040
And so depending on how many people show up, we might actually get more done, I guess.


00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.560
But the main thing is to figure out who's going to keep meeting, like, and what are


00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.760
those meetings going to be like?


00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.020
And why we would be meeting.


00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:06.180
So I think the best reason to keep meeting is either to be learning Git and Markdown


00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.380
or maybe even better to be learning Git and Markdown on a collaborative project.


00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.260
Maybe a little toy project to start off with, one that we can work on without stressing


00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.620
too much about what the content is and then end up with something that we might be able


00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.900
to turn it into something useful.


00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:41.440
We might kind of just put it on the shelf and go, "Okay, that was a lot of fun."


00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.820
Another good outcome after that practice of doing something together would be to kind


00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.180
of review recap after action review where we got to.


00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:06.500
Howdy, Kiel, is that how am I gonna unmute? Hi, it's Kyle. Good morning. Hi Kyle, good


00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:16.940
morning. Hi Kyle. Good morning. So just to recap real quick, I would be happy if we


00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.600
got out of this call, kind of knowing who's going to continue doing this call and why


00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.560
and how, basically. So maybe we should go around and talk about what we would like to


00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.920
get out of this exercise, these exercises. Ray, I'm going to pick on you and have you


00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.640
go first if that's okay, because you kind of kicked this off, and I know that you've


00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.040
got stuff that you want to get done and maybe get in Markdown as a tool to do it.


00:02:48.040 --> 00:03:00.480
Yes. So thank you. So what interested me in this is the collaborative aspect of it, which


00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:11.440
comes in, I guess, two versions. One is that it's a good way to share thoughts that I have


00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.000
for the beginnings of a white paper that some people have read it and decided that it was


00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.560
really dense and difficult and they had to read it a few times to understand.


00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.640
So I want people to actually help write it, to give people to better understand it and


00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.280
also have contributors to shape the ideas and improve it.


00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.480
related to this same project, it's going to make sense to put together a deck.


00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.520
And I, although you've cautioned against this, what I really would like to do is see people


00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:03.080
collaborate with trying to do the skeleton of a deck in Markdown as well before moving


00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.000
into some sort of final format for the output


00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.640
to actually be able to deliver a presentation.


00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.160
I have a third motivation beyond that,


00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.160
which is that although in the past I've written code,


00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.040
it stopped quite a while ago.


00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
And so I've never worked with Git at all.


00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.760
It just wasn't part of my experience.


00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.160
And so for me to understand the workflows


00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.160
would remove another thing from me being able to jump in


00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.680
and actually contribute to code


00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.540
because I would know that practice.


00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.000
Think you're muted.


00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.600
- Yes, I am.


00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.420
Thanks, Ray.


00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:11.920
I am going to share my screen and let's say I'm recording already.


00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.420
It's recording in this tab.


00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:23.920
I'm going to share my screen on the markdown thing and then in my Jitsi tab I've got to


00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.480
to make sure to select the screen share.


00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.680
Otherwise, it won't record very well.


00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.440
I'm not convinced this is recording well,


00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.120
but it's a little better than nothing.


00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.440
OK, I think it's kind of set.


00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.680
Thanks for bearing with me in Jitsi


00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.000
and recording and screen sharing.


00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.840
So line 19, in a more perfect world,


00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.840
we would have kind of collectively grabbed Ray's nicely


00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.400
set up points there.


00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.040
Let's go back and do it together.


00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:11.280
So Ray wants to expand from single-player writing


00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.440
to multiplayer.


00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.840
Ray and I guess everybody, one of the ways that we say collaborative writing is to call


00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.560
it multiplayer.


00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:48.760
And part of the reason is to express ideas better for a wider audience.


00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.120
And then another thing, I feel like there was, Rafe, if you could help me a little bit,


00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.200
The next thing was working on a particular project.


00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.040
Was that it?


00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.040
- Yes, but even before that,


00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.760
to express the ideas better,


00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.760
I would say to possibly to add ideas from others.


00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:23.360
- I'm gonna say more people instead of others,


00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.200
if that's okay.


00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:32.200
And I'm going to make a temporary line here and then I'm going to put your last thing, which I also remember.


00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.800
So then I feel like line 22, you had a specific project you were kind of in mind.


00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.200
You didn't really talk about it much, but I think that's kind of what...


00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.760
I heard that. Maybe I'm wrong.


00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.480
Yes. So I have a specific project in mind and I'm interested in


00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:14.160
doing multiplayer writing around both the white paper and the presentation for it.


00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.960
Yep.


00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.960
Okay. Thanks for that. I'm going to go ahead and close this out. I'm going to go ahead


00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:48.240
Okay.


00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
Thanks for that.


00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
Who wants to go next?


00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240
Who wants to go next?


00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.240
I'll go.


00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.240
Thanks, Kyle.


00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:04.240
So Ray invited me to learn more about this, which I found interesting and exciting.


00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.240
My background is in technology since the 80s, so I've always worked with developers.


00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:16.240
And then in the 90s, I had a software publishing company, publishing games, utilities, lifestyle software.


00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.520
and then I had an interactive agency, and I've worked in recent years a lot for big


00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.960
technology companies and in between a lot of other stuff, FinTech, a lot of SaaS platform,


00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.320
and worked closely with developers most of my career.


00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.600
So anything that gets me to understand better the way that they work and to be able to work


00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:43.560
through more dynamically with them in those flows is interesting to me.


00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:51.320
When I was with Palo Alto Networks last year, I was working a lot on code to cloud marketing


00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.320
strategy.


00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.160
So, you know, GitHub is a big place where problems occur there.


00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.400
So Git is top of mind for me.


00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:11.320
And I'm currently working on a SaaS platform ag tech project within an agency.


00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.800
And so I'm working again with developers.


00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.800
So it just seems to make sense to me, along with the training I'm doing for


00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:26.160
chat GPT, I think this type of thinking aligns really well with learning,


00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.160
prompting, and all kinds of things, including learning to code,


00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.320
which is the next step in chat GPT.


00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.760
So I don't know how to summarize that more, but


00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.760
So there's a lot of things that align and are interesting to me about this.


00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.760
From that perspective.


00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:59.760
I especially noticed when I worked for these big tech companies, instead of directly for smaller startups where I would meet with the development team,


00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.760
which is often dozens of programmers, on how a product works or how a platform works.


00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.120
The bigger companies, you get really siloed.


00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.280
So anything that helps me better understand the developer side,


00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.640
I think, is really powerful.


00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:23.640
Cool.


00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.920
So line 25 through 29, does that kind of capture pretty well?


00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.680
Yes, thank you.


00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.680
Great.


00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:42.960
And I especially like what's on line 29 that you've got.


00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.640
I think I'm teaching people how to use Chat GPT.


00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.920
And one of the observations I've got


00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.880
is that working with Chat GPT is kind of a low impact way


00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.960
to learn how to think through how to explain something


00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.420
and how to ask people something better.


00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.080
You have a bot that's infinitely patient


00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.720
and reasonably conversational


00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.800
and you get a lot of practice.


00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.560
And, okay, I'm trying to communicate something.


00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.160
How can I break it down in a way


00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.280
that gets the response I want?


00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.140
And it's just a robot response


00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.780
and it's either makes you happy or sad


00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.280
that it's like, oh, well,


00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.600
I didn't ask the question very well


00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.240
It gave me an answer, a very interesting answer, but that's not the question I wanted.


00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.840
So I've learned that I ask questions much better.


00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.720
I had a doctor's appointment recently and I heard myself asking the questions after the session


00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.800
with the doctor, the questions I asked were very much informed by how well I have gotten,


00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.640
how much better I've gotten at asking questions and prompting, you know, people or bots.


00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.240
It's very interesting.


00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.240
And the other thing is, it's a,


00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.980
the other thing that I can,


00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.140
because I'm a developer and I know,


00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.320
I have a kind of a cheat code to what development is.


00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.320
It's pretty easy for me to go to chat2BT and get it to,


00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.160
it's actually really good at writing code.


00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.680
So I can go over and say, you know,


00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.840
write the code that does this,


00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.360
but I kind of know how to ask


00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.220
and I kind of know what to do with the code once it's done.


00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.460
So there's something where more people who will be using


00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.340
chat GPT and whatever comes afterwards,


00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.580
you kind of need the basics of how to code


00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.260
and how to work with code.


00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Even if you don't really know how programming works,


00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.900
you kind of have to know what's reasonable


00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.740
and what you can ask and what you can't ask


00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.600
and things like that.


00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.860
So I really like that line 29, Kyle.


00:13:53.860 --> 00:14:02.140
By the way, while we're at learning about coding and stuff like that, I think it was


00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.380
Marvin Minsky back in the day.


00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.660
He worked a lot, or Simon Papert, maybe.


00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.460
They worked a lot on teaching.


00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.780
There's a couple parts of coding.


00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.340
One of them is boring learning of all the syntax and stuff like that.


00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.300
And that's kind of maybe the poster child often for coding.


00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.540
There's another thing which is breaking down problems into, you know, modules and being


00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.620
able to instruct like a turtle, a drawing turtle or something like that, how to get


00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.420
stuff done.


00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:41.340
Understanding how to algorithmize things is actually, I think, a literacy that we need


00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.340
more of.


00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:48.260
And ChatGPD opens up the ability to actually act on, you know, that kind of knowledge with


00:14:48.260 --> 00:15:00.260
a lot of force, a lot of capability. So, who's next? Butler, maybe?


00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:07.820
I'll go next. Sure. You want to go first?


00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:14.220
Yeah, I can go next. So, I'm tech savvy, but I'm not a coder and I'm not a developer, and


00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.580
I am less interested in this conversation and how this all gets done,


00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.780
then I've got some projects that want to use something like this maybe.


00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.920
So would that be appropriate to talk about?


00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.820
>> Yeah.


00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:33.380
>> I'm going to seriously resist getting into the tech conversations here.


00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.460
So let me just paste these in to the markdown.


00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.700
There's three classes of projects I'm looking at.


00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.580
They're going to just all go in at once, I guess.


00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.080
Yeah.


00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.660
That's real.


00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.420
Yeah.


00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.340
So one is co-writing, working with people


00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.800
on developing proposals for white papers together.


00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.380
We're doing that in Google Docs right now.


00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.700
What you all are talking about here is something better


00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.660
than Google Docs.


00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.380
Yes.


00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.820
That's number one.


00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.620
Number two, two books I'm trying to put together.


00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.540
One is a curated multi-author anthology.


00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.620
And the idea would be for people to post their chapters


00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.020
and then cross-comment on each other's chapters


00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.740
and possibly do that in the open,


00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.340
possibly behind a cloak to be revealed


00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.100
once it's at a certain level of knowledge.


00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.580
And the third is a book that I'm primary author of,


00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.420
but I'm thinking about doing it in the open,


00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.940
kind of serialized with comments and revisions


00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.580
within either tightly curated


00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.380
or wide open group of collaborators.


00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.060
So I'm curious about whether what's under discussion here


00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.540
provides appropriate platform for that.


00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.740
Participation by people who are not coders,


00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.420
who are just writers, thinkers, and want


00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.340
it as simple as possible in terms of workflows.


00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.220
Do not want to be able to look--


00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.800
folks who don't need to open the hood and look at the engine,


00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.700
but just get in the car and drive somewhere.


00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.540
Thanks, Gil.


00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.460
That's great.


00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.380
Can we expand GTPR?


00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.100
Yeah, sure.


00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.660
These are-- this one is Getting the Prices Right.


00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.220
This is about what I see as a fundamental mess


00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.580
of the climate and environmental story, which is that the markets


00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.460
lie.


00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.660
And we don't pay the real prices of things.


00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.780
And so I've got an outline for--


00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.140
it's like a 15-essay book that dives


00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.380
into the various aspects of that, both conceptually


00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.780
and policy and so forth.


00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.100
I'm ready for the next one.


00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.660
Excuse me, you kind of dropped out for me there.


00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.540
Yeah, tell me when you're ready for the next one.


00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.100
Next one, go for it.


00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:51.220
Yeah, so the SDSC is the structural defects


00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.860
of Capitalism, which is a hyphenated word.


00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:01.460
With a capital I, or--


00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.940
No, I don't think so.


00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.820
I think just like that.


00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.580
I mean, maybe this, maybe, yeah.


00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.360
I mean, yeah, let's just leave it as that for now.


00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.740
So, do you want the summary of the book


00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.100
or you want to just leave it?


00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.180
- No, that's good.


00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.660
As long as we kind of know it's a book


00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.100
and maybe I guess a little bit the size of it


00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.300
or something like that.


00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.580
- Don't know the size of it yet.


00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.980
I'm building the outline.


00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.220
- Book is close enough.


00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.740
If it's a blog post, that's one thing.


00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.020
- No, it's not a blog post, it's a book.


00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.240
And put book in quotes,


00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.800
'cause the question I keep asking myself


00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.540
whenever I think of these things is,


00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.360
like book in quotes, but what if it's not a book?


00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.200
- Yeah.


00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.260
Let me put a note kind of down here at line 35.


00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:57.340
And yeah, I wanted to also note that anybody can,


00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:04.320
with the link in the chat, you can get to this thing.


00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:11.040
You don't have to sign in and then these buttons on the upper left control the view.


00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:18.960
The left two have the editing view on the side here.


00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:25.680
Real quick, I wanted to take off on your book thing a little bit.


00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:32.920
Jerry Mikulski and I and some other folks are working on something called Neo Books.


00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.280
A number of people have talked about Wikibooks.


00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.440
Most recently, Jordan.


00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.880
Different people mean different things by Wikibooks.


00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:49.440
But anyway, Jerry's thought a fair amount about Neo-books


00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.420
and also has articulated, I think.


00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.700
So if you poke through his brain,


00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.880
you could probably find Neo-books.


00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.080
And then a Neo-book is probably something


00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.680
that might exist as an e-book,


00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.480
maybe even as a printed book.


00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.160
but it's probably also a website


00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.060
and it's probably also a set of presentations.


00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.240
It's probably also, you know, podcasts and videos


00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.520
and all kinds of things, right?


00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.940
So once you've got that,


00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.540
the curated information narrativized,


00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.540
then, you know, book is gonna mean something different


00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.120
than it did 50 years ago.


00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.140
And let me go, since we don't have too many people,


00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.740
I can kind of get into a little detail


00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.680
and go back over your points.


00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.420
For co-writing, this can be better than Google Docs.


00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.820
It can be worse.


00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:50.700
But it gets better and better the longer the piece is.


00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.940
So if you're writing a blog post,


00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.940
you might use HackMD for a blog post.


00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.540
You would not use Git.


00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.740
Markdown is actually always a great thing


00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.500
learn. It's used in a lot of places and it's good to know Markdown.


00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.380
Yeah, and I'm doing my work primarily in Obsidian.


00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.980
Yeah, so there you go.


00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:16.340
And I'm assuming for the moment that it's going to be Obsidian to Obsidian publish


00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.260
as the first layer, but who knows?


00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.700
Yeah, so there's a thing that I stuck in here. There's a great article called


00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:29.620
Writing Long Form Content with Obsidian on 54. There's a plugin now that kind of,


00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:37.060
It's a little, it makes Obsidian kind of like Scrivener Lite, and you write separate pages


00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.700
as chapters or whatever you want, and then there's a plugin, the long form plugin,


00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:47.780
that will output the whole thing for you and output it in PDF or, you know, different formats.


00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.740
I'm sorry, you put that in chat?


00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.620
It's on line 54 in this doc.


00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.380
Oh, got it. Thank you.


00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.620
And to make it easier to click a link if you want to, you use the right pane rather than


00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:10.580
trying to figure out how to copy and paste. Either way. So for co-writing, Gil, if you're


00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.780
using Obsidian already, you kind of know that it's a good tool for managing a lot of markdown


00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:21.780
files. A lot of, you know, it can replace a lot of Scrivener, for instance, as a writing tool.


00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:30.820
The thing that we're mixing in here, the idea that we want to mix in is the idea of using Git


00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:36.420
as well. And Git has a fair bit of overhead, a fair bit of friction to get started with,


00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:44.100
but then it is super productive once you kind of get going. So if you can get into that,


00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:51.140
you know, if you can get over the speed bump at the front, you start singing. And then


00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.140
And for your other things, for a book,


00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:04.100
getting the prices right would be a great thing


00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.420
to do with Git and Markdown,


00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.340
as long as all your other co-authors


00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.100
or almost all of your other co-authors


00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.580
are willing to get over that speed bump of let's use Git.


00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.380
- How big is the speed bump, Peter?


00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.780
- If you're using Obsidian already,


00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.240
there's a very nice plugin called Obsidian Git


00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.120
that hooks Obsidian up to Git.


00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:36.360
Let me show you because again, we've got some time here.


00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.040
- And if you can tell me again,


00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.120
the first thing, the other plugin that you mentioned


00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.520
that was the Scrivener Lite.


00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.640
Did you put that in your timer?


00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.280
- Yeah, line 54.


00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.640
Obsidian itself is kind of a Scrivener lite.


00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.240
And then the only thing it's kind of missing is output.


00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.920
And then so the long form plugin adds the output thing.


00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.920
Let me reshare my screen a little bit


00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.480
and show you Obsidian Git.


00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:20.500
[ Pause ]


00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.920
>> Yeah, the question for me is going


00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.340
to be how big is the speed bump?


00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:24.760
Because --


00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.600
>> Yeah.


00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.140
>> And some of these folks may just have an assistant that,


00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.480
you know, they give -- they deliver a text file


00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.220
and somebody else --


00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:31.380
>> Yeah.


00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.360
>> -- can find it for them.


00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.760
That may be --


00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.680
Yeah, it's kind of--


00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.480
well, yeah.


00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:43.880
Can you make that bigger by any chance?


00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.960
The text or the--


00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.640
Never mind, I just closed the chat, so it's better.


00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.320
Cool.


00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.400
This is Obsidian.


00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.360
This is a markdown page.


00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.960
This particular-- I think this is peterkaminski.wiki.


00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.440
Yeah.


00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.880
So sorry to kind of jump ahead, folks.


00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.560
But one of the things we use Obsidian for


00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.720
is kind of information management.


00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.480
Another thing is for collaborative writing.


00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.520
Another thing is to make websites.


00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.640
This one is actually kind of to make websites.


00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.220
Can I stop you for a second?


00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.280
Can you do collaborative writing in Obsidian?


00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.040
Does it support a multi-user access to a page?


00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.600
- It's a longer answer.


00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.880
- Okay, skip it for now, we'll get it another time.


00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.380
- Let me answer it real quick.


00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.960
Especially Bill Anderson and I,


00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.800
we've played with a lot of different ways to do this.


00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.800
And it turns out that you kind of want to,


00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:57.360
the short answer is yes,


00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.360
and the long answer is it kind of depends


00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:08.640
you want to do it and how like crazy making you mind it being. It turns out that Git is


00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.320
actually still a pretty good way to do collaborative writing.


00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.320
Or Obsidian Git.


00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:22.240
Yeah. And it doesn't matter actually if the other person is using Obsidian. They could be using


00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:30.480
Emacs or VS Code or whatever, but often it's Obsidian. My pattern is to do interactive sessions


00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:39.280
and things where you're collaborating right in the teeth of it on HackMD. It's easy to move


00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:48.400
files back and forth from HackMD to Obsidian. So my typical thing is to work cheek by jowl


00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:56.880
in HackMD always. And then when we break up over the course of the week, we're working together,


00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:05.280
then I would fall back to Git. For depending on who you're working with, Git might be a step too


00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:13.760
far kind of. So then it turns out that if you just use Obsidian Sync, or you can use, which is a paid


00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.960
service from the Obsidian, the fine folks at Obsidian. You can also use sync thing,


00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:30.940
which is very similar, it turns out. There's almost real-time syncing. So, if somebody


00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.840
was editing this page, if this was synced through Obsidian sync and someone else was


00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.800
editing it, I would see their edits come through like a few seconds later. We don't have a


00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.200
a way to negotiate through Obsidian Sync,


00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.360
we don't have a way to negotiate conflicts.


00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.740
So if I'm typing on one paragraph,


00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.540
somebody else is typing one paragraph,


00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.160
I think we're both gonna be sad at some point.


00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.000
And you start ending up with,


00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.040
Obsidian Sync I think is working with the whole file,


00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.560
it's not working with the lines of characters.


00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.500
HackMD works character by character,


00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.120
and even if you are both typing in the same place,


00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.600
you'll move apart from each other a little bit


00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.480
and it's fine, it works really well.


00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.000
So then the Git-based collaboration


00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.760
is even a little chunkier than that,


00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.880
than Obsidian Sync.


00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:32.680
And it turns out that you also need a side channel.


00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.560
You need to use Metamost or Slack or Discord


00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.800
or WhatsApp or Signal or something like that to say,


00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.200
"Hey, I'm gonna start working on this table of contents


00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.240
"and elements of great fiction, is that okay?"


00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.960
And the other person will also go, "Yeah, that's cool."


00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.720
And maybe remember to link to these other pages


00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.840
or something like that.


00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.560
You wanna synchronize what you're working on


00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.920
and you need a chat channel to do that.


00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.520
So then once you're using Git,


00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.300
this is the control panel for Git, Obsidian Git.


00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.120
It turns out that like 90% of the time


00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.120
you can just click this one button, actually two buttons.


00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.280
You click this button to pull changes from the cloud


00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.580
and you click this button.


00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.660
Yeah, you got pull and push.


00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.180
You kind of stay away from the push one.


00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.900
This is like a super push that does everything for you.


00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.880
So between that pull and the super push,


00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.240
you can kind of just fire and forget


00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.880
and not worry about it very much.


00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:47.200
In the context of this inquiry, the Markdown plus Git inquiry, I'm hoping and I think Ray's


00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.600
project will support it.


00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:58.560
There's another level of using Git where you're actually using -- you use separate branches


00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.360
for people working on separate things.


00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:10.120
And you can do fine grained commenting and things like that on particular versions of


00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120
this.


00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.120
So, through the Git and GitHub magic, you can have multiple, like many, many versions


00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:23.920
potentially of this whole book and work together on it in a very fine grained way and accept


00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:30.840
some of the changes, but some of the changes for further discussion, reject some of the


00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.000
changes, all of that kind of stuff.


00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.280
That's what software developers do with their code


00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:36.920
all the time.


00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.160
And that's the super turbocharged version.


00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.840
And in this case, you're talking about Markdown plus Git?


00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.920
Yes.


00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.920
OK.


00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.080
With the speed bump.


00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.760
OK.


00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.000
So the first speed bump is, I guess,


00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.720
if you're just using Git for working together with people,


00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:05.880
It's kind of a wash whether you use Git or Obsidian Sync or SyncThing.


00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:11.520
If you're using Git, you can keep leveling up and get more sophisticated.


00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.920
You can get very sophisticated, very powerful collaboration.


00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.600
But it requires not only getting over that first speed bump, but then going up a bit


00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.040
of a learning curve.


00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.400
It's not as steep as it seems, I think, but it's also not very well documented and not


00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:34.840
very, the path isn't well trodden. So that's part of the Git plus Markdown project is to try to,


00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:40.280
you know, trod this path. That's, I think, not that big of a deal, but it feels like a big deal


00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.480
still. Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. So I think, I think for my purposes, I'd probably


00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:52.920
start with the Markdown, with the, with the, with the Obsidian Git thing. Yeah. You might even...


00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.480
or mark down Obsidian and then get started there


00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.000
and see what we know about each other


00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.240
and what the workflow looks like


00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.880
and then talk to you about starting to work.


00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.780
- That sounds good.


00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:09.880
If you don't mind paying for Obsidian Git


00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.000
and you have to, every person working together


00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.420
needs Obsidian Git.


00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.620
And then each person can host five documents.


00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:28.260
Obsidian Git is a little bit easier place to start, I would say, because it's built


00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.260
into Obsidian.


00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.900
Obsidian Git is a third-party thing, and it carries a lot of baggage from Git into it


00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.420
that can be a little bit overwhelming.


00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.100
Good baggage or bad baggage?


00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.100
Mostly bad.


00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.100
Okay.


00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:48.220
So, Pete, you kept saying Obsidian Git, but I think you meant Obsidian Sync, about paying


00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.980
And only five documents?


00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:56.020
Obsidian Sync is paid, and each person can share five documents.


00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.100
Sorry if I mixed that up.


00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.060
Five documents or five vaults?


00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.700
Five vaults.


00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.740
You're entirely right.


00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.240
Yes.


00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:13.700
And Obsidian Sync is easier and a little bit less effective.


00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.700
Obsidian Git is a little bit more effective and a lot harder,


00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:23.860
but it also is a gateway to superpower


00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.400
and Obsidian Sync is not.


00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.760
- Obsidian Git's got a lot of users.


00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.980
- Yeah.


00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:36.200
While we're talking about Git clumsiness,


00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.700
I also wanted to point out down at line 85,


00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:49.580
I've got a link to a page of GUI clients for Git and actually let's look at one or two


00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.740
of those real quick.


00:33:54.740 --> 00:34:06.580
Let me show you command line Git actually.


00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.540
So first of all, it's command line.


00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.140
I'll make the command line a little bit bigger here.


00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:20.780
I guess I should have made it bigger


00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.380
and then made the window bigger.


00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:29.500
So you type things like get status.


00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.960
You can actually edit, I'm gonna open this.


00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:42.780
I could be using one of the beauties of Markdown and Obsidian and things like that is I can


00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:53.860
be well, I also have this open in Obsidian, but I'm going to go through here and maybe


00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.660
I'll even edit this page.


00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:02.660
So I'm going to open that with Typora and make a change here.


00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:18.660
Yeah, actually, I'm going to trash this.


00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.660
So it's like, whoops, I made a mistake.


00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.660
I won't publish this to the web.


00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:33.940
So this is kind of an example of me editing some stuff,


00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.620
maybe making a mistake.


00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.740
If I say get status now, it's like,


00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.260
hey dude, this has changed.


00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.960
So then I can say, what are the changes?


00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:49.580
Green is added, red is subtracted.


00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.980
So, you know, here's the thing I did there.


00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.060
This is where I screwed things up and kind of changed it.


00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.360
So this is what a developer,


00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.420
developers sometimes have a little fancier tool,


00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.060
but this is kind of a deal with developers.


00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.060
So then to deal with this,


00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.100
I can say things like I can check out, check for branches.


00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:20.100
I could get checkout dash B.


00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:29.800
I can put my changes on a branch.


00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:36.340
I can actually, anyway, you type things like this


00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340
and you get the idea.


00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:44.140
Let's look at tower and I'll just type in


00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.340
And I'll just show you the screen cap here.


00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.780
Well, actually I'll show you two things.


00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.620
We'll click on pricing first.


00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.500
100 bucks per user per year.


00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.340
It's like, oh my, you know, oh my gosh.


00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.220
I think you might be able to get away with one user.


00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.240
This is even fancier than you probably need,


00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.780
but you can probably get away with 70 bucks a year.


00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.100
So Tower is like the Primo version.


00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.540
It also has Mac and Windows.


00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.620
There's a nice Mac one that doesn't have a Windows version.


00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.300
So you're not all using the same tool, which is a problem.


00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.500
But anyway, here's the red and green thing.


00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.740
Here's branches, instead of having to keep in your head


00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.260
what branches are and how they work and stuff like that,


00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.860
you get this beautiful picture of it.


00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:34.860
And if you kind of like poke around at the features here,


00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.540
it's got lots of fancy things for managing


00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.920
all the Git magic.


00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.920
And again, all that Git magic is superpower stuff.


00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.460
It's like you all of a sudden you get 5X productivity or 10X productivity.


00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.200
It's mind-blowingly cool.


00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.040
But it's not cheap.


00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.080
And either you pay money and use this GUI tool.


00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:04.400
And even this, it's not super intuitive for me to figure out what all these lines mean.


00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.600
It's kind of a difficult map to understand.


00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.280
Bill and I use this command line thing


00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.120
and keep that picture in our heads, actually.


00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.920
Ray?


00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.720
- Yes, so question about your comment


00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.920
about 5X or 10X productivity.


00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.380
Was that remark specific to writing code,


00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.840
or would you say that that applies


00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.800
for collaborative writing too?


00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800
- You know, the funny thing is,


00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.080
I think it would actually be better


00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.440
with collaborative writing.


00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.840
- Wow.


00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.080
- I think


00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:47.760
with code, code is complex enough


00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.240
that you kind of get bogged down in little details


00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.800
and that's where the collaboration work goes.


00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.440
I think with writing, you could,


00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.880
you know, you could leverage the tools to


00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.160
like multiply your group intelligence


00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.340
in a way that doesn't happen too much in coding.


00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.700
- Yeah, Pete, thanks for that.


00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.700
My assumption now is that this stuff needs to be invisible


00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.360
to the contributors, but could be very helpful


00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.200
for the production team.


00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.380
- Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.


00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.260
And especially for your use cases,


00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.160
There's a nirvana where you've got a particular,


00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.240
a nirvana for me maybe.


00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.440
You've got a product or a project which is all writing,


00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.840
there's no tech involved.


00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.400
And each of your writers has enough


00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:56.740
patience and tolerance for uncomfortableness


00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.200
to go over the speed bump


00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.440
and then climb up the learning curve.


00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.760
And that may sound like a crazy thing for me to guess,


00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.760
but it happened all the time


00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.660
when computers were harder to use.


00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.800
My wife, for instance, is not a techie.


00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.240
She was using a command line.


00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.200
She was using a command line email program.


00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.240
So the thing that you do now with Twitter


00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.280
or with Outlook or something like that,


00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.000
she had to go through kind of the same level of clunkiness


00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
and weird speed bumps and learning curves


00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.560
just to be able to send email and things like that.


00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:41.760
It's not, we have a conflation that only technical people


00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:47.120
can learn how to do like these little fiddly computer things.


00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.700
I don't, I've seen that not to be true.


00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.280
Even this command line stuff, which I don't think,


00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.720
nowadays I'd probably use the GUI for the non-tech folks.


00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.560
But even as this, you know,


00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.960
there's just a few things you learn.


00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.040
You learn to type this, you learn to type that.


00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.840
You have a little cheat sheet.


00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.480
- I think I'm command line without lining indentations.


00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.520
I think everybody could get pretty quickly.


00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.520
- Yeah.


00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.360
Yeah.


00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360
- So, all right.


00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.680
- And it's pretty rote stuff.


00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.640
You know, there's, you just go through your checklist


00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.840
of steps and you just do it.


00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.720
And it's, but it's not.


00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.180
So structural defects of capitalism you've got


00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.240
in the open with a large group of collaborators,


00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.060
you don't have the opportunity to train


00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.420
each of the collaborators up into like,


00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.040
oh, I'm using Git and GitHub pull requests


00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.160
and all that kind of stuff.


00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.320
You don't have that opportunity with the mass public.


00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.480
Those folks are not going to be the folks


00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.240
that can tolerate that.


00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.160
- Yeah, and the mass public might need something


00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.120
like a G-Docs type of commenting feature,


00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.480
but even that is too much for some humans.


00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.480
- Yep, yep.


00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:05.680
Having said that, there's another nirvana for everybody.


00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.920
GitHub enabled a kind of collaboration


00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.160
where you collaborate with people you don't know.


00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.240
So once you, kind of like Kylie,


00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.360
once you have that unlocked,


00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.160
once you know how to do a little bit of Git stuff,


00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.760
all of a sudden you can collaborate


00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.640
with many people you don't know and vice versa.


00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.100
Many people that you don't know can drop in on your project


00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.080
without even talking to you and improve it.


00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.200
And improve it in a way that's continually gated


00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.200
by whatever, you don't give them right access


00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.720
to the core thing.


00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.140
They have right access to their copy of the core thing


00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.600
and then they can say, hey, compare my core thing


00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.960
with your core thing and grab whatever you think


00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:58.400
an improvement. So that's another like you know another huge jump of superpower stuff that that


00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:06.160
we should be able to get to in text someday. Thank you. Yeah sure thing Gil. Butler do you want to go?


00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:14.960
Yeah sure. Just one last thing. I dropped in at line 38. I searched for Neo Books. There's a


00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.040
a German site called neobooks.com that


00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.400
appears to offer something.


00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.120
Google Translate won't translate it,


00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.000
so if one of you can figure out what it says,


00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.960
that might be worth a look for somebody.


00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.760
Cool, thank you.


00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:33.120
OK, yeah, so for me, I'm a software developer,


00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.680
so at least I fairly know how to use Git and GitHub


00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.120
or wake up collaboratively with other developers.


00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.200
So I got interested in this in order to learn more


00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.200
about multiplayer writing.


00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.000
And at the moment I'm learning technical writing.


00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.160
So I thought it would be a nice project


00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.320
to learn more about writing.


00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.320
Yeah, then last month, yeah.


00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:07.200
So last month I came across D.School,


00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.240
the collaborative work in progress.


00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.480
So they actually do almost the same thing.


00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.840
So I thought, then I found like most of the work


00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.280
that had already been done,


00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.040
much of it is session on the project


00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.640
and a lot has been written.


00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.400
So it was just like us trying to make a few changes


00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.100
when I got on course with the team,


00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.600
the guys that are leading it.


00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.600
So I thought maybe joining a project


00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.540
that's starting from scratch


00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.820
and then being able to build up from there


00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.100
would be something interesting.


00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.620
And then it would really help me


00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.600
in terms of learning how to write


00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.420
and then more so write in groups


00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:57.260
'cause last year, I did an RKB, that's Kennel.


00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.580
So Kennel Block 7, in case folks are not in Kennel.


00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.580
So we were writing things about decentralized finance


00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:17.320
And we did make amazing effort, but then I think we struggled


00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.880
a bit in terms of getting the goals that we had put down


00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.000
and then achieving them.


00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.800
So I thought, yeah, maybe doing this would be interesting


00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.400
and then help me learn more about collaborative writing.


00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.800
Yeah, thanks.


00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.400
Thanks, Butler.


00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.360
That's great.


00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.960
So I'm going to add kind of the last thing that you said.


00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:49.520
I want to learn how project management works


00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.600
with collaborative writing.


00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:57.000
As it happens, I've got a lot of experience,


00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.280
and some of the rest of us do, kind of in this group,


00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.560
about project management and collaborative writing


00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.680
and how to do those together.


00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.660
So that would be really cool to work on.


00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:16.580
Anybody else have got something for this?


00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.920
And if you do, you can keep adding.


00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:26.100
Let's talk, I'd kind of like to get pretty much done


00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.120
at the top of the hour.


00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.300
So we've got nine minutes left.


00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:38.100
Let's talk about-- sorry, let me figure out


00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.540
how to stop screen sharing here.


00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:55.940
Let's talk about whether or not we're going to meet up again


00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.700
and maybe think about how to get started


00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.900
on either a small project or a big project.


00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:08.180
I'm up for meeting again.


00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.480
It doesn't have to be at this time every week.


00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.660
We could either have like a get together session


00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.660
and kind of figure out what we're going to do


00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.660
and then maybe do some smaller groups,


00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.660
one, two or three people working on a project.


00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.420
We could meet every week, we could meet every other week.


00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.860
- So I'd like to do that.


00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:36.260
I'm most interested in actually experimenting


00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.720
with a few folks about trying to, you know,


00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.360
deal with this so-called speed bump,


00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.340
little activation energy.


00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.780
And I think I can help


00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.560
'cause I've had a lot of experience with that.


00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.400
- Yep.


00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.620
- And I think that would be something valuable


00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.740
because if we could learn how to help each other


00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.580
use these tools to collaborate around writing,


00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.600
we could then help other people do the same thing.


00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.060
- I'm interested in that.


00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.460
Oh, I'm sorry, Bill.


00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.900
- And I just think that would be a valuable contribution


00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.060
rather than just saying, oh, that's what developers do.


00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.940
It's like, just throw that out, you know?


00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.540
We're all human beings here and we got keyboards.


00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.120
So turn me loose.


00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.300
- Kyle?


00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.260
- Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm interested in that too.


00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.500
And that last item about collaborative writing


00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.340
and project management, boy, have I been in the midst of that.


00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.300
I mean, I have a lot of experience in project management


00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.660
in my past, but I don't usually do that now.


00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.860
I do more marketing strategy and writing.


00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.020
So when I've been in those workflows,


00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.860
it almost always ends up people write over one another


00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.460
in Google Docs, and nobody has the timing right.


00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:56.220
And then people pop in, like another example from Palo Alto,


00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.020
there could be--


00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.020
you never know who's going to pop in when you're


00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.420
trying to think and write.


00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.740
There might be a VP coming in because they


00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.220
have access or product marketing managers or product managers.


00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.300
And the PM and then other--


00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.740
the creative department who's proofing it.


00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.700
There's almost-- never smooth is what I can say.


00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.260
It's like almost every one of my projects


00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.540
got derailed many times for those reasons.


00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.900
And a lot of the work I would do would, you know,


00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.580
I'd have to get the old versions back.


00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.140
And I'd always just do something


00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.740
that's not very sustainable.


00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.220
Save down the copy I was working on


00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.820
just to make sure I had it.


00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.260
'Cause it's easier to reference that


00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.420
than to go back to different versions a lot of times.


00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.940
So I think that's a huge problem


00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:45.340
'cause my experience in these larger tech companies


00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.740
is that they're working so fast and furiously


00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.300
that they forget any protocols.


00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.300
They don't, and everybody copies Google Docs


00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.620
'cause they can't get in, so they'll make a new copy


00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.340
and invite people to it.


00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.820
And everything is now the web version, the browser version.


00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.900
So you end up working in like 100 tabs


00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.860
instead of having any desktop applications.


00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.580
So those are things that slowed me down tremendously


00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.800
and I think took down the productivity of teams


00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.780
that I was working on it were like 75 people


00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.660
where basically we'd work for months


00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.380
and just waste all that.


00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.780
You know, most of the work gets wasted.


00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.300
So, but you're being driven to work really fast.


00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.300
And they call it agile,


00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.340
but of course it's not agile at all.


00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.160
- Yeah.


00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.920
Those are great use case horror stories.


00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.760
(laughs)


00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.340
- It's in the trenches.


00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.320
- Yeah, yeah.


00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:43.060
So it looks like we've got kind of quorum to keep meeting.


00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:50.740
One quick question I have, we've got the community forum on


00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.700
Passionate People.


00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.500
I'm kind of moderately satisfied with it.


00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.940
And there's a cool thing where I can add more course material,


00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.620
pre-recorded video courses.


00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.260
And then that's easy to get to from the Passionate People


00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.180
community.


00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.260
As a forum, it's kind of clunky for me.


00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:14.180
And what's even more galling is it doesn't speak Markdown.


00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.020
So what do people think?


00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.540
Should we keep using the PathShifts People forum?


00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.500
Should we make a mailing list?


00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.500
Should we use-- there's a Mattermost server


00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.300
I run that--


00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.460
it's kind of like Slack, but that works really well.


00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.820
We need a way to coordinate offline.


00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:40.060
How do people feel about Passionate People, Community,


00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.940
Mattermost, mailing list, something else?


00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:48.980
- Well, I think that a mailing list is something


00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.700
that everyone will be familiar with, so it has that plus,


00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.700
but people sometimes get really a lot of emails


00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.980
and it would be noisy to use it for discussions,


00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.980
So Mattermost might work well for that.


00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:12.700
And the forum, it might still be good for announcements.


00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:18.180
I just don't know if it would be needed separately


00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:22.060
if there were another channel like a Mattermost


00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.420
or an email list.


00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.500
- That's well said, Ray.


00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.820
And along with email being kind of a,


00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.640
it can get kind of like a swamp.


00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.100
It's hard to find stuff in your email box.


00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.420
The other thing is it's not kind of real time.


00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:44.820
So a chat system like Mattermost is a lot more real time.


00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.500
And if we use a chat system,


00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.700
then we can practice collaborating.


00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:52.540
Thanks, Gil.


00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.260
we can practice collaborating, you know,


00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.660
semi-synchronously, which works really well


00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.940
with get and markdown.


00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:05.740
I'm gonna suggest that we go to Mattermost.


00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:11.480
Butler, Edwin, Kyle, does that sound okay?


00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.420
- Sure.


00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.860
- Yes. - Yeah.


00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.420
Yeah, sure, that sounds okay.


00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.240
- Awesome.


00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:24.660
Bill, I know you're gonna drop.


00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.820
- Yeah, I just wanna say one thing.


00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:30.060
So I would like this, I'm in for the time being here,


00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.140
you know, let's meet again and try and do something.


00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.020
I also said I'm willing to help people


00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.020
if they're one who don't know about Git


00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.780
because I know some things


00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.860
and I also faced my own breakdowns using it.


00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.460
So I think I might be able to be helpful


00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.800
in trying to help people get used to it.


00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.300
- Bill is super knowledgeable


00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:58.300
And he's kind of taking lead on trying to figure out


00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:03.300
this speed bump thing, how to get it usable for folks.


00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.820
He and I, both Bill and I have been working together


00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.940
in the massive wiki world,


00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.740
which is very similar to where we are now.


00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.980
In the massive wiki world,


00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.500
we're trying to figure out how to make it easier


00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.760
for people to join up and use it.


00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.880
So we've got some thinking


00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.980
and some stuff written down already


00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.200
on how to get through that.


00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.200
I will set up a Mattermost channel,


00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.360
and I will email that to the same people


00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.640
I emailed things to last night.


00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.360
So we'll probably pick up a few of the people


00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.600
that did make this call.


00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:40.840
And then let's figure out when to get together next.


00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.920
This is an okay time for me, but it's not best.


00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.920
So let's coordinate online, I guess,


00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.980
and we'll figure it out in the chat.


00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.440
Anything else?


00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.880
I can stay for a while if folks want to stay


00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.880
or we can kind of break up and just get onto Mattermost.


00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.420
We'll see, Bill.


00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.940
I can give a quick demo of Mattermost.


00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.440
Is everybody on CSE Mattermost already per chance


00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.120
or is this a new thing?


00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.840
- For me, it's a new thing.


00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.320
So I think it would be great for you to go through it.


00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.680
So I just see how it works in it.


00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.640
Yeah.


00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.480
- Great.


00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.600
The recording is gonna stop in a few minutes, I think,


00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.880
which is fine.


00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.920
It's not a problem at all,


00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.560
but for the people on the recording,


00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.220
if you missed the rest of this,


00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.500
just get in touch and we'll get you going.


00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.620
Okay, let me share my screen again.


00:55:41.620 --> 00:56:05.700
And you can, to start off with, I'll email out the links to all this stuff again, so


00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:09.500
don't feel like you have to.


00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:20.100
There's a server called chat.collecticencecommons.org.


00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:29.740
So a thing to know is there's -- you can see Mattermost on the web or you can see it in


00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.700
the desktop app.


00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:36.460
I'm not sure that you would see this right away.


00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:44.840
So, if you're in the web, you just go to chat.collectivesensecommons.org, you sign up.


00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:53.280
A thing to know is that if you get asked for a team, you use the team Agora, A-G-O-R-A.


00:56:53.280 --> 00:57:01.280
So let me switch over to what it looks like once you're in.


00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.220
It's pretty easy to get set up, you know, get an account, and it's free.


00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.140
So the desktop app looks like this.


00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:12.380
The desktop app and the web look exactly the same.


00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:21.500
So let me switch to a decent channel here.


00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:27.320
Where you start off first is a channel called Town Square.


00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.820
Over here are all my channels.


00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:32.780
If you're used to Slack, MatterVest is very much like Slack.


00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.360
So there's just a few things that are a little bit different,


00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.040
but pretty much the same.


00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.800
So everybody gets put into a channel called Town Square.


00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.640
And then when you start, you'll have very few channels


00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.320
over here.


00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.620
But you can go find a channel and search


00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:55.120
for different channels here and then join them, basically.


00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.680
I don't know.


00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.680
Maybe that's enough for now.


00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.680
I guess let me show you a few more things.


00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.680
There's a thing called threads.


00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.000
So if you see a little section like this,


00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.520
this means that there's a threaded reply to this message.


00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.120
And you click on that and you see over here,


00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:24.400
you can actually change between threaded mode


00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.120
and not threaded mode.


00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.020
It's called collapse reply threads.


00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.320
If I turn this setting off,


00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:37.320
What happens is it shows me all the messages just kind of in a row.


00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:43.320
And so you'll see that this is, you know, this is in reply to that,


00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.320
but now you can't see that it's part of a thread.


00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:49.320
You just see all the messages one after another.


00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:54.320
So depending on how you like it, if you wanted to see all the messages


00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.320
and not have to worry too much whether or not they're in a thread


00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.860
or not find out that they're in a thread,


00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.200
turn off collapsed reply threads.


00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.340
If you want to see the threading,


00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:09.100
then settings display collapse reply threads on.


00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:14.020
So then the flip side of that is you have to look


00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:19.020
for these little thread markers.


00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.300
Let me see if there's a couple of interesting,


00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.820
one of the channels that you might want to check out


00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.780
is Coffee Shop.


00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:37.140
We don't have a lot of threading.


00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.740
Another one is Tools and Technology.


00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:48.300
Any of the channels that have brackets and a word in front


00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:52.300
of them belong to a certain group,


00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.060
but you're welcome to join them.


00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.240
So OGM, when I was talking about NeoBooks,


00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.960
NeoBook is an OGM project.


00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.860
And so in the name of the channel, there's that OGM.


01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.280
And then it's about NeoBooks.


01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:12.560
And this is a good example of, for a lot of calls, if--


01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.480
sorry, a lot of channels are part of a project


01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.440
where you want to have meetings.


01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.760
Up at the top here, there's often a Zoom link


01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.960
for the weekly meeting.


01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.520
This is the time and the Zoom link.


01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.320
This is a pretty common thing to do.


01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.840
Any questions?


01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.320
Sorry, that was kind of a rushed, quick tour.


01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.840
- I think it's all right.


01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.960
Yeah, as you said, I think it's much like Slack


01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.600
and I know how to use Slack at least, so.


01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.360
- Yeah, it's very similar to Slack, yeah.


01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.200
- Yeah.


01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.760
Anybody else?


01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.600
No, I don't have a question right now.


01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.800
Just to thank you for the session.


01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.600
You're welcome.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.520
Thanks for coming.
