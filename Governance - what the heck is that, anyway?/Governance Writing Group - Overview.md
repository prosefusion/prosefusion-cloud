# Governance Writing Group - Overview

First meeting forked from [[Prose Fusion, 2023-10-16]], with Bill A, Jordan, Pete.

## An Opening offering from J: 

Greetings Messrs Anderson and Kaminski. 

So what is [[Governance]] anyway?

The word “Govern” derives from the Latin meaning “To Steer”. It begs the question: 

_How do we [[Individually And Collectively]] navigate our Vessel(s) towards [[The Goal]]?_  

Having fixed our [[Aim]], how do we get from [[Where We Are]] to [[Where We Are Going]]? 

Governance is a [[Core Function]] of [[The Body]] of Society. It is one of the primary Organ Systems of The Body that must be stacked up, aligned, and co-operated in order for a Union to move away from pain, suffering, and dysfunction, towards its Destiny. 

It is one System, composed of Sub-Systems, and nested inside the Super-System of a Social Organism.
