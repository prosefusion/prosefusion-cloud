This note is an example of a so-called single-scene LongForm project. Single-scene meaning, I think, that there is only this one page.  

For a group of folks writing together, a multi-scene (meaning, I think, a separate page for each scene) format may be a better way to co-write.

I named the entire LongForm project "LongForm Experiment 1" just to get started. Renaming these folders and pages seems easy to do. (So names can change to protect the innocent.)
