# Prose Fusion

Prose Fusion is a project team exploring and documenting how to do high-performance, team-based, collaborative writing. To aid our human coordination, we use tools like Markdown, Git, chat, and project management.

We have a chat channel on CSC Mattermost (free registration required): <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/prose-fusion>.

You can contact [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) for more information.
