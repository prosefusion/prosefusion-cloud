# Prose Fusion

Prose Fusion is a project team learning and documenting how to do high-performance, team-based, collaborative writing. We use Markdown, Git, chat, and project management as our foundation.

We have a chat channel on CSC Mattermost (free registration required): <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/prose-fusion>.

You can contact [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) for more information.
