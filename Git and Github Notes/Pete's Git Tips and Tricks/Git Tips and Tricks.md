# Pete's Git Tips and Tricks

These notes were copied directly from Pete's personal private wiki on 2023-10-18. There was no reason to keep them private, but they also are written as personal notes to self, without a lot of context. Feel free to improve them!

Not in any particular order (well, alpha by first word, but that doesn't create any useful semantic order):

- [[Delete all local branches]]
- [[Delete any local branches that have been deleted upstream]]
- [[Git Tag and Push Tag Upstream]]
- [[Git Workflow Diagram]]
- [[How to find the Git commit that introduced a string in any branch]]
- [[Instead of "git pull", if you know you don't want any local changes]]
- [[List untracked files]]
- [[Oliver Steele's "My Git Workflow"]]
- [[Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH]]
- [[Sync fork to upstream, discard local commits]]
