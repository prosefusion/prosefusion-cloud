# 5. Centralized Git Collaboration Models
*Massive Wiki Starter Guidebook version 0.1.1*

(for people who know a little or a lot about Git and GitHub; get them oriented, and clear that we're using the simplest model first, but that more advanced models are okay for particular teams)

## Pull and Push
- the starting model for Massive wiki users

## Branch and Merge
- includes a pull and push loop inside branch and merge

## Fork and Pull Request
- can include pull and push and branch and merge
- intermediate-level, unless you don't have write access to the central repo, and then it's required even at starter level
