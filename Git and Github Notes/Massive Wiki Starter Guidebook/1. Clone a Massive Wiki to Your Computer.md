# 1. Clone a Massive Wiki to Your Computer
*Massive Wiki Starter Guidebook version 0.1.1*

## Install Software

Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
Prerequisite: establish a Github account.

Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## About GitHub and Repos

Each Massive wiki is stored in a repository, or "repo" for short.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a central website for storing and sharing repos.

Using this guidebook, you will make a "clone" (copy) of a repo from GitHub. The cloned repo is stored on your computer in one of your folders.

## Find and Clone The Wiki's Repo

In this guidebook, we use a wiki called "Massive Sandbox".  Click the link below to go to its GitHub repo:

https://github.com/massive-wiki/massive-sandbox

Find the green button that says "Code" and click it.

In the drop-down menu that opens, click "Open with GitHub Desktop".

When GitHub Desktop opens, it will have a small window that says "Clone Repository...".

Under "Local Path", click the "Choose..." button and choose a place on your computer to make the repo.  A good place is in a folder called "GitHub" in your Documents folder.

* My Documents or Documents
  * GitHub
    * massive-sandbox

When you've chosen the location, click the "Clone" button.

You are done with GitHub Desktop for now.  You may close the application.
