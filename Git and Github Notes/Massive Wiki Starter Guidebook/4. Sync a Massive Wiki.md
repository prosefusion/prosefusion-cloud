# 4. Sync a Massive Wiki

(make sure you've cloned the repo and set up the "Obsidian Git" hotkeys, as explained in previous steps)

- pull, with Ctrl-L or Command-L
	- if there were issues, see the page, "Resolving Git Sync Issues"
- push, with Ctrl-U or Command-U
- consider giving other people in chat or whatever a headline of what you changed

when to pull

when to push

Why we don't push on a timer: (This rationale is better located with setting Obsidian-Git options)
  (i) partial work sessions get pushed (merge conflicts on co-edited documents);
  (ii) Obsidian Git push pushes all changed files;
  (iii) pushing when you are done is part of the Massive-wiki work practice
