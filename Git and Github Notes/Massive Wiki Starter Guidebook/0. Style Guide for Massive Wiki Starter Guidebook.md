- Audience is people familiar with installing desktop apps and using plain text editors (e.g., TextEdit or Notepad)
- Use plain, declarative sentences. Explain arcane concepts briefly, and avoid a lot of depth; save that for an intermediate handbook.
- Need to sprinkle in screenshots and diagrams.
- Need to identify additional resources, like Markdown how-tos, Obsidian how-tos, etc.  Short and concise videos are preferred.
- Primary output formats are a static web site and PDF.  Avoid using internal wiki links, there's enough stuff going on already. (Note: this needs some explanation.)
- Section numbers in page titles: use incrementing integers; it's okay to have to renumber when pages get added or moved.
- Each page will have a [semver](https://semver.org/) version number at the top that represents the release number of the whole guidebook, incremented on each release (publication to static site + PDF). There will not be a page-specific version number; just use the git log for that (This last sentence also needs some context.)
