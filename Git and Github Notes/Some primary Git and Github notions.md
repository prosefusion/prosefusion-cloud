# Some primary Git and Github notions

2023-09-01: *Bill Anderson's*(WLA) thoughts on the primary terms and aspects of having a working model of using Git and Github for collaborative writing. 
(note: these ideas are similar to those PK outlined in the minutes of [[Markdown and Git for Collaborative Writing, 2023-08-17]])  

- Git: the software that keeps track of changes to text files in a collection called a repository.  
- Github: a centralized (cloud-based) system that stores repositories. These repositories can be shared by many people. Git and a system like Github allows documents to be shared and the changes made to them to be tracked and managed.  

 - Using Git requires that `git` software be installed on your local computer.  
 - Using Github requires you to have an account and to establish credentials that authorize and authenticate using the remote repository.
