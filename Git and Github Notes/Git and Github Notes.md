[[Working with Git and Obsidian]]  

2023-09-01 (WLA): the following documents were written to introduce people to Massive Wikis, installing them and using them. Most of them are more than two years old. The plan here is to rewrite them to focus more on Git and collaborative writing work, or to take what is useful for that from them for `prosefusion` documentation.  
 - [[HackMD notes and GitHub Sync]]  
 - [[Resolving Git Problems]]  
 - [[Windows New User Git and Github - Obsidian setup, 2021-06-20]]
