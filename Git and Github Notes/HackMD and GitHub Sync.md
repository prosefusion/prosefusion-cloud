# HackMD and GitHub Sync

A HackMD note can be connected to a GitHub file, making it possible to do realtime collaborative editing on a Massive wiki page that's centralized at GitHub. Yay!

Access the "Versions and GitHub Sync" dialog from the three-dot menu in the upper right toolbar area.

Some tips and tricks:

- Use a named version to sync with GitHub.  The version name will act as the commit message.
- After naming the most recent version, make sure to select that version, and only that version, when you Push.
- If the "Save as version" button is light-colored and disabled, it means that there is already a saved version -- perhaps auto-saved --  that is even with the current state of the document.  To give an auto-saved version a name, open the disclosure arrow for "Current note content" and click the top-most date.  Inspect the diff area, and confirm that there are no changes between that version and the current note content.  Now the "Name this version" button should be active; click "Name this version" to give it a name.
